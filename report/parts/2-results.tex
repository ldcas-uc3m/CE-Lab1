\section{Results}
Due to a lack of time / computing power (I wasn't able to set up the configuration of jtr in Guernika) and space, I only tested the first four dictionaries with the rules, plus rockyou.txt as a dictionary attack.\\

The following passwords were cracked:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item usuario\_12\_7: usuario\_12\_7
    \item usuario\_12\_9: choelouise
    \item usuario\_12\_10: alexutza
\end{enumerate}

It took an hour for rockyou.txt and 8 hours for the rule attack. After a day of trying with incremental attack, it only found the passwords I already had.
