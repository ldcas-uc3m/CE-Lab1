\section{Methodology}

\subsection{Dictionaries}
I used 4 dictionaries for the attack:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Top 500 worst passwords:} A list of the 500 most common passwords, this will cover the general cases for passwords.
    \item \textbf{hotmail.txt:} A list of ~9000 (allegded) leaked passwords from Hotmail, also covering for general cases.
    \item \textbf{200 spanish names:} A list of the most common spanish names, as we assume the passwords are (mainly) from spanish people.
    \item \textbf{lab-inf-uc3m:} Dictionary generated from the webpage of the university's Computer Lab's website, using Cewl.
\end{enumerate}
